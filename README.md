**PHASE 1: ASK **

In this phase, we do two things. We define the problem to be solved and we make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations. Stakeholders are people who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome.   
Let's break that down. First, defining a problem means you look at the current state and identify how it's different from the ideal state. Usually there's an obstacle we need to get rid of or something wrong that needs to be fixed, or a situation that needs to be moved to the next level. In this case, for instance, we want to identify what trends exist in the usage of BellaBeat's smart devices and using this informtion, find out how these trends can help influence BellaBeat's marketing strategy and improve their performance and sales. 
Another important part of the ask phase is understanding stakeholder expectations. The first step here is to determine who the stakeholders are. In this case - Urska Srsen, Sando Mur, and the BellaBeat Marketing Analytics Team. There can be lots of stakeholders. But what they all have in common is that they help make decisions, influence actions and strategies, and have specific goals they want to meet. They also care about the project and that's why it's so important to understand their expectations from the onset. 

**PHASE 2: PREPARE**
